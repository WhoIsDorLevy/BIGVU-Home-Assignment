# BIGVU Workshop Android App
My home assignment, given to me by BIGVU.

The app shows a Workshop list of BIGVU, with images and videos.

To run the app, simply download to your android phone the "BIGVU Workshop.apk" file(from the project's main directory), install and run it.
To run on Windows/Mac/Linux, make sure you have the latest version of Android Studio already installed. Then, clone the repository to your Android Studio projects directory, then open the project and run it.

I hope you'll enjoy it!
